UniFi Network Controller is a centralized management system
for Ubiquiti UniFi products.

The default user is set to 'nobody.' You'll want to change
this by passing:

UNIFI_USER=user UNIFI_GROUP=group ./unifi-controller.SlackBuild

If you want to start at boot, add the following to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.unifi-controller ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc./unifi-controller start
fi

And the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.unifi-controller ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc./unifi-controller stop
fi
