This package installs an optional daemon script at:
/etc/rc.d/rc.nzbget

The default init runs as root:root with its data directory as:
/var/lib/nzbget

You probably want to change this.
Edit the init file directly, or you can change the default
user and group at build time:
    
    # NZBGET_USER=user NZBGET_GROUP=group \
        ./nzbget.SlackBuild
