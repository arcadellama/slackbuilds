script:

# useradd -r -d /var/lib/sonarr sonarr

You'll also need to add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sonarr ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc./sonarr start
fi

And the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sonarr ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc./sonarr stop
fi
