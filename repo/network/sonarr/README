Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor
multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will
grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to
automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when
a better quality format becomes available.

You'll need to create a sonarr user in order to run with the provided init
script:

# useradd -r -d /var/lib/sonarr sonarr

You'll also need to add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sonarr ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc./sonarr start
fi

And the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sonarr ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc./sonarr stop
fi
