Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent
users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will
interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them.
It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of
existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes
available.

This package installs a daemon script at
/etc/rc.d/rc.radarr

The default init runs as radarr:radarr with its $HOME as
/var/lib/radarr

Example script to add a radarr user and group:

    # useradd -r -m -d /var/lib/radarr -s /bin/false -U radarr

It is recomended to have radarr in the same group as your
download client(s). You can change the default user and group
at build time:

    # RADARR_USER=user RADARR_GROUP=group ./radarr.SlackBuild
