Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor
multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will
grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to
automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when
a better quality format becomes available.

This package installs a daemon script.
Enable it with:
# chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.sonarr

The default init runs as sonarr:sonarr with its $HOME as
/var/lib/sonarr

# useradd -r -m -d /var/lib/sonarr -s /bin/false -U sonarr

It is recomended to have sonarr in the same group as your
download client(s). You can change the default user and group
at build time:

# SONARR_USER=user SONARR_GROUP=group ./sonarr.SlackBuild
